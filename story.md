One day, Jennifer took a ATV down to the grocery store. Jennifer wanted to buy apples today, to make a fruit salad. Unfortunately, all apples were sold out. Frustrated, Jennifer decided to buy shampoo instead. On the ATV back to the house, Jennifer made a plan. Back home, Jennifer shredded the shampoo and put it in the salad. It tasted questionable!
