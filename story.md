One day, Oisin took a ATV down to the grocery store. Oisin wanted to buy bananas today, to make a fruit salad. Unfortunately, all bananas were sold out. Frustrated, Oisin decided to buy toilet paper instead. On the ATV back to the house, Oisin made a plan. Back home, Oisin shredded the toilet paper and put it in the salad. It tasted wonderful!
