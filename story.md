One day, Jennifer took a ATV down to the grocery store. Jennifer wanted to buy bananas today, to make a fruit salad. Unfortunately, all bananas were sold out. Frustrated, Jennifer decided to buy shampoo instead. On the ATV back to the house, Jennifer made a plan. Back home, Jennifer opened the shampoo and put it in the salad. It tasted interesting!
