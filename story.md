One day, Tiago took a roller skates down to the grocery store. Tiago wanted to buy bananas today, to make a fruit salad. Unfortunately, all bananas were sold out. Frustrated, Tiago decided to buy shampoo instead. On the roller skates back to the house, Tiago made a plan. Back home, Tiago opened the shampoo and put it in the salad. It tasted fabulous!
